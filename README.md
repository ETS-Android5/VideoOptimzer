## Open Source Code Package

Video Optimizer allows mobile application developers to test the network performance of video, images and other files for compression, speed, battery drain and other aspects of performance.

The Data Collector is the component of the Video Optimizer application that captures the data traffic of a mobile device and stores that information in trace files that can be analyzed using the Video Optimizer Data Analyzer.

The Video Optimizer Data Analyzer is the component of the Video Optimizer application that evaluates the trace data collected from an application and generates statistical and analytical results based on recommended best practices.

This Open Source Code Package contains all of the code needed to build both of these Video Optimizer components.

**Video Optimizer 3.1 Features**

- Added	New Best Practice "Adaptive Bitrate Ladder"
  - under Video Best practices to help analyze Adaptive Bitrate and design it to stream files more efficiently over HTTP networks

- Video Enhancements
  - HLS Live stream enhancements for wider support of live video streaming applications
  - Additional support added to analyze traces supporting HLS and DASH manifest format for traces taken on Android devices
  - Improved naming of Video Stream for better clarity - Stream names are displayed based on the URL of the Master manifest

- Other Enhancements
  - In Diagnostic Tab, under TCP/UDP table, a new column called “Round Trip Time” is added to calculate TCP session round trip time. For UDP, DNS and QUIC sessions, the round trip time is not applicable and will show N/A
  - Graphic chart in Diagnostic Tab now includes a new label called "Session Count" along with a tool tip that displays the total number of sessions when user hovers on various points on the graph
  -	'Landscape' option is now enabled when capturing traces using Command-Line Interface
  -	Save & Close Functionality button under File -> Preferences -> Video is enhanced to check for precise values before saving it


**Known issues in Release 3.1**

- Some of the video traces don’t display Byte and time information under Video Summary table on Windows and Linux platform
- In some traces, not all segment gaps are identified.
- Playtime propagation and therefore stall detection issues appear intermittently in some traces
- With Ubuntu LTS Versions 16.x.x, VLC versions greater than 3.0.8 doesn't allow for video playback on Video Optimizer. Trace Collection and opening the trace will work but Video Player doesn’t play.
