## Open Source Code Package

Video Optimizer allows mobile application developers to test the network performance of video, images and other files for compression, speed, battery drain and other aspects of performance.

The Data Collector is the component of the Video Optimizer application that captures the data traffic of a mobile device and stores that information in trace files that can be analyzed using the Video Optimizer Data Analyzer.

The Video Optimizer Data Analyzer is the component of the Video Optimizer application that evaluates the trace data collected from an application and generates statistical and analytical results based on recommended best practices.

This Open Source Code Package contains all of the code needed to build both of these Video Optimizer components.

**Video Optimizer 4.0 Features**

- New Export capabilities includes:
  - Export entire trace results to Excel format, allowing easy comparison of multiple traces.
  -	Ability to export all Requests & Responses in the TCP/UDP Flow table.
  -	Ability to export multiple tables at once from the Diagnostics tab.

- Redesigned Video tab shows more relevant data, including a new graph showing the download bitrates of all video & audio segments.

- Support for Brotli text compression including:
  - Text Compression Best Practice now calculates potential data savings for using Brotli compression.
  - Ability to view uncompressed Brotli text in the Content View tab.
- Ability to Interpret DASH .mp4/.mpd video stream segments.

- Detection of 5G network connections and type (Sub 6 v mmWave) using the Android Telephony API.

- Color coding of the Set Startup Delay button to indicate when it has been set.

- Detection of Android screen touch events and allowing for setting the Playback initiation time based on touch events

-	Informative popup windows to assist Android 11 users to configure certificates needed for secure trace collection.

-	Simplified VPN permissions can be granted via ADB instead of prompting from device.

-	Updated calculations of KB and MB to reflect standard 1000 notation (and not 1024).

-	General bug fixes for video analysis and best practice analysis.


**Known issues in Release 4.0**

- The 5g network is not displayed in the Network type graph, unless there is a toggle between WIFI and Data. This is a limitation in the Android Telephony API.
-	Trace collection cannot be started when the device is on the lock screen, otherwise the VPN collector app will freeze.
-	For occasional traces, HLS video streams show the segment number as "0" for all segments.
-	Intermittently, when there is an issue with video analysis of a trace, some images from the previous trace will still be visible in the following graphs:
  -	Throughput (Video tab)
  -	Video chunks (Diagnostics tab)
  -	Buffer seconds (Diagnostics tab)
  -	Buffer Mbytes (Diagnostics tab)
